# WIKI IN THE NEWS

This is a simple project made to display current news topics from the In the news portal page from Wikipedia.

### The reason for its creation
This little repository was built for its submission the [Crazy Cool Developers Challenge.](https://crazycooldevelopers.github.io/) 

### Inspiration
It was inspired by an art piece I saw at the Mana Contemporary Art Exhibition in New Jersey.
